# markov-text-from-tweet
Generate random texts based on a collection of tweets, using Markov Chains. This example uses tweets from Donald Trump (@realdonaldtrump), which were downloaded from [here](https://github.com/bpb27/trump-tweet-archive/tree/master/data/realdonaldtrump)

Files need to be stored in the 'tweets' subfolder.
